              The Dodge Challenger is the name of three different generations of
              automobiles (two of those being pony cars) produced by American
              automobile manufacturer Dodge. However, the first use of the
              Challenger name by Dodge was in 1959 for marketing a "value
              version" of the full-sized Coronet Silver Challenger. From model
              years 1970 to 1974, the first generation Dodge Challenger pony car
              was built using the Chrysler E platform in hardtop and convertible
              body styles sharing major components with the Plymouth Barracuda.
              The second generation, from model years 1978 to 1983, was a badge
              engineered Mitsubishi Galant Lambda / Sapporo, a coupe version of
              an economical compact car. The third and current generation is a
              pony car that was introduced in early 2008 originally as a rival
              to the evolved fifth generation Ford Mustang and the fifth
              generation Chevrolet Camaro.

              The Mercedes-Benz GLS, formerly Mercedes-Benz GL-Class, is a
              full-size luxury SUV produced by Mercedes-Benz since 2006. In each
              of its generations it is a three-row, seven-passenger vehicle
              positioned above the GLE (formerly Mercedes-Benz M-Class before
              2016). The GLS is considered the flagship of the marque's SUV
              lineup, although the body-on-frame G-Class (originally intended
              for military off-roading but also offered in luxurious trims) is
              more expensive and has been in production longer. The GLS shares
              the same unibody architecture with the GLE. Most GLS vehicles are
              assembled at the Mercedes plant in Alabama, except for a small
              number of early 2007 production vehicles which were manufactured
              in Germany. The first generation model (X164) was manufactured
              between 2006 and 2012 and was replaced in 2013 by the new
              generation GL-Class (X166).

              The Mercedes-Benz C-Class is a series of compact executive cars
              produced by Mercedes-Benz Group AG. Introduced in 1993 as a
              replacement for the 190 (W201) range, the C-Class was the smallest
              model in the marque's line-up until the W168 A-Class arrived in
              1997. The C-Class has been available with a "4MATIC" four-wheel
              drive option since 2002. The third generation (W204) was launched
              in 2007 while the current W206 generation was launched in 2021.
              Initially available in sedan and a station wagon configurations, a
              fastback coupé (SportCoupé) variant followed and was later renamed
              to Mercedes-Benz CLC-Class. It remained in production until 2011
              when a new W204 C-Class coupé replaced it for the 2012 model year.

              September 1996, currently in its fourth generation. The first two
              generations of the Audi A3 were based on the Volkswagen Group A
              platform, while the third and fourth generations use the
